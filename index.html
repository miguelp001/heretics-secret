            <img src="/chapter1.png" alt="Abstract cage of ice" class="chapter-art">
            <p>The blizzard didn’t just hide the world; it erased it. The snow piled against the timber walls of the
              village near the Eastren Wood, turning the settlement into a tomb shared by the living.</p>
            <p class="interactive-text"
              data-reveal="In this silence, the only sound was the wind and the snapping of frozen branches.">...</p>

            <p>Elara stood over the red ruin that used to be Penelope. The baker lay on the grey snow, a bundle of torn
              rags and silence.</p>

            <p>"Wolf," Jarek said. The village hunter stood like a statue carved from worry. "Starving. Desperate. I’ll
              track it."</p>

            <p>Elara knelt. She ignored the gore and looked at the story written in the snow. The drag marks were deep,
              heavy furrows.</p>

            <p>"The tracks don't leave, Jarek," Elara said, her voice lost in the wind. "They go into the village. Not
              away."</p>

            <p>Jarek flinched. It was a small thing, a crack in his stone mask. <span class="highlight">He was hiding
                something.</span></p>

            <p>Rolf stepped into the lantern light. The priest of the new faith wore his suspicion like a second skin.
              He
              looked at the corpse, then at Elara.</p>

            <p>"The Old Gods have left us to the dark," Rolf spat, his voice sharp enough to cut the cold. "Perhaps the
              Lady in Red has a secret to stitch this meat back together?"</p>

            <p>Elara touched the symbol of the red snake hidden beneath her cloak. Holun, who fills men with knowledge
              and
              hollows them out, does not offer comfort. She offers truth, and the truth here smelled of copper and
              betrayal. The beast was already inside the walls.</p>

            <img src="/chapter2.png" alt="Abstract wolf in fire" class="chapter-art">
            <p>The attacks did not stop. Two nights later, a guard lost an arm to the shadows. Fear is a cold thing, and
              it spread through the village faster than the frost. Rolf fed it. He preached in the square, demanding the
              village purge itself of the "unclean."</p>

            <p>Elara followed the silence to Jarek's cabin.</p>

            <p>She didn't knock. She slipped the latch—a talent granted to those who serve the goddess of secrets—and
              stepped inside. The cabin smelled of wet fur, sickness, and old blood.</p>

            <p>Livia lay strapped to the bed. Her skin was a tapestry of bruises; her bones shifted and ground together
              as
              the curse tried to reshape her form. Lycanthropy is not a disease; it is the rage of the soul given claws.
              It is the man screaming inside the wolf.</p>

            <p>Jarek sat in the corner. He held a silver knife, useless in his shaking hand. He was weeping.</p>

            <p>"She didn't mean to," Jarek whispered. "It was in the woods. A month ago. We thought it was just a bite."
            </p>

            <p>"You're feeding her," Elara said. "Dragging the bodies back here."</p>

            <p>"I can't kill her, Elara. She's my wife."</p>

            <p>Elara looked at Livia. The woman's eyes were yellow, wild and terrified. The beast was winning. This was
              not a problem of medicine; it was a problem of the spirit.</p>

            <p>"There is a way," Elara said. "An Old Rite. Dangerous. It requires a price."</p>

            <p>"Anything."</p>

            <p>"The heart of the sire," Elara said. "The thing that turned her."</p>

            <p>Jarek went to a heavy chest and threw it open. Inside, floating in a jar of brine, sat a heart the size
              of
              a fist.</p>

            <p>"I killed it the night she was bitten," Jarek said. "I kept it. I don't know why."</p>

            <p>"Because the gods love a tragedy," Elara muttered. "Prepare her. We do it tonight."</p>

            <p>Magic in Nightsdeep is a transaction. You give a piece of yourself to change the world. Elara drew the
              runes of Holun on her skin with ash. They burned, a sharp heat against the cold.</p>
            <p class="chant">The Claw. Calm the Beast.</p>

            <p>Livia thrashed against the ropes. The full moon pulled at the tide of her blood.</p>

            <p>"Hold her," Elara commanded.</p>

            <p>She sliced the sire's heart. Black blood oozed out. She began the chant, a low sound that grated against
              the silence. The air in the room grew heavy, the shadows stretching and twisting.</p>

            <p>Outside, the snow crunched under heavy boots.</p>

            <p>"Open up!" Rolf’s voice cracked like a whip. "We know what you harbor, Hunter! We know the witch is with
              you!"</p>

            <p>Jarek looked at the door, then at Livia. "Finish it," he snarled. He grabbed his axe.</p>

            <p>The door splintered. Rolf did not come alone; he brought the fear of the village with him. They carried
              torches—fire, the only thing the desperate trust.</p>

            <p>"Heretic!" Rolf pointed a trembling finger at Elara.</p>

            <p>Livia roared. It was a sound of wet tearing. The wolf pushed against the skin.</p>

            <p>Elara ignored the door. She shoved the heart-matter into Livia’s mouth and pressed her hands to the
              woman’s
              chest. She pushed her will into the sickness. The Claw. She visualized the beast retreating, the human
              spirit reclaiming its vessel.</p>

            <p>Jarek swung the axe, striking the doorframe. "Back! All of you!"</p>

            <p>"Burn them!" Rolf shrieked.</p>

            <p>The mob hesitated. They saw Livia. She wasn't a monster; she was breaking. Her fur receded, her snout
              retracted with the sickening pop of cartilage moving back into place. The horror of the change reversed
              was
              worse than the change itself.</p>

            <p>Elara slumped. The rune on her arm vanished, leaving raw, red skin.</p>

            <p>Livia gasped. She was naked, covered in sweat and blood, but her eyes were brown. Human.</p>

            <p>The silence in the room was absolute. The mob stared. They had come to kill a monster; they found a
              miracle
              they didn't understand. Rolf’s power crumbled in the face of the truth.</p>

          <img src="/chapter4.png" alt="Abstract figure in snow" class="chapter-art">
          <p>Elara packed her satchel. The village was quiet. The blizzard had broken, leaving the world scoured clean
            and empty.</p>

          <p>Livia was alive. She would have nightmares. She would ache when the moon was full. But she was herself.</p>

          <p>Jarek stood by the door. "They let us be," he said. "For now."</p>

          <p>"Rolf has lost them," Elara said. "But fear remembers. And kindness is forgotten quickly."</p>

          <p>"We're leaving," Jarek said. "We can't stay here. Not after they saw..."</p>

          <p>"Go," Elara said. "The road is hard, but staying is death."</p>

          <p>Elara stepped out into the snow. The cold bit at her exposed face. She looked back at the village. It
            looked peaceful, buried under the white drift. It was a lie.</p>

          <p>She adjusted her cloak and began walking toward the tree line. She had cheated the dark this time, but in
            Nightsdeep, the dark always waits for you to stumble. You just try to keep walking.</p>
